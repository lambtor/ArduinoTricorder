# ArduinoTricorder
WIP list of assets that could be used with arduino tricorder 

Home Screen         exists, but needs to support other sensors & layout refactor<br/>
RGB Color Scanner   OK<br/>
Left-side LED       OK, needs multi-mode support (stacking, unified flashing, etc)<br/>
Power LED           Functional, needs to be connected to input voltage instead of color cycling<br/>
Button Support      OK - using easybutton library pulled from elsewhere on github
