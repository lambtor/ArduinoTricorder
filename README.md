# ArduinoTricorder
WIP list of assets that could be used with arduino tricorder 

Home Screen         exists, but needs to support other sensors & layout refactor
RGB Color Scanner   OK
Left-side LED       OK, needs multi-mode support (stacking, unified flashing, etc)
Power LED           Functional, needs to be connected to input voltage instead of color cycling
Button Support      OK - using easybutton library pulled from elsewhere on github
