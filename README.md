# ArduinoTricorder
WIP list of assets that could be used with arduino tricorder 

Home Screen           refactored, now showing a very simplified equivalent of windows BGInfo<br/>
RGB Color Scanner     OK<br/>
Climate Scanner		  OK - updates bar graphs to reflect data without requiring internal loops<br/>
Left-side LED         OK, needs multi-mode support (stacking, unified flashing, etc)<br/>
Power LED             Functional, will either cycle colors or show color based on battery power %<br/>
Button Support        OK - using easybutton library pulled from elsewhere on github<br/>
Microphone Spectrum <br/>
Visualization         OK - not the most accurate thing, but has a very high refresh rate.  Uses AdafruitZero_FFT library for FFT calculations.<br/>

to do: 
sound playback via separate wav/ogg board
